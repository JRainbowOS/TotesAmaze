# TotesAmaze
Implementations of Path Finding / Maze Solving Algorithms

Various path-finding algorithms in methods.py (so far, only Dijkstra, but will add A*).

Solver class in solver.py wraps the given method.

Node class in node.py is each junction in a maze or node in a graph.

Network class in network.py groups nodes into a weighted graph.

Run network.py to see example network being solved using Dijkstra's algorithm.

TODO: Write Dijkstra's algorthim
TODO: Write maze_to_graph that converts a binary raster into a vector graph ready to be solved.
